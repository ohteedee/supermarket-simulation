# supermarket-simulation
In this jupyter notebook, I explored customer behavior within a supermarket. 

I also used transition probabilities (Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation) to simumate the behaviour of customer inside the supermarket. 

It is still an ongoing project with a lot of improvements on the way.
